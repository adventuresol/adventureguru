										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The exploration of space stands as one of humanity&#8217;s greatest achievements. While history has hailed the men and women who reached the cosmos, and those who helped them get there, much of the infrastructure that sent them skyward lies forgotten and dilapidated. This may look a little unusual, but swishing through the various mini-screens is immensely satisfying.</p>
<p>A 2017 survey found that employers have a very or somewhat difficult time finding people with the requisite soft skills. But what if employers are looking for soft skills and are not seeing them? The vast majority of mid-size and large employers in the US, UK and Canada utilize Applicant Tracking Systems.</p>
<figure id="attachment_363" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-363" style="width: 1920px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://adventuresol.github.io/adventureguru/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/p1.jpg"><img class=" td-modal-image wp-image-363 size-full" src="https://adventuresol.github.io/adventureguru/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/p1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1184" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-363" class="wp-caption-text">Space trips about to start next year</figcaption></figure>
<p>Roland Miller has spent nearly half his life chronicling these landmarks before they are lost forever long been obsessed with space as a child, he dreamed of being an astronaut. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) make it possible for employers to post new positions online and manage the hundreds of applicants who typically respond to each opportunity. No human hiring manager reviews hundreds of applications.</p>
<blockquote><p>my friends and colleagues have offered up reactions ranging from outright bemusement to adoration.</p></blockquote>
<p>The image stabilizing works well on all the neon lights that pepper Tokyo, while even people were neatly captured. There&#8217;s some noise, but it compares favorably against older Galaxy phones. Daylight meant effortless captures and some really nice shots, if I say so myself.</p>
<h4><strong>HARDWARE</strong></h4>
<figure id="attachment_364" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-364" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://adventuresol.github.io/adventureguru/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/p2.jpg"><img class=" td-modal-image wp-image-364" src="https://adventuresol.github.io/adventureguru/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/p2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="416" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-364" class="wp-caption-text">Fully controllable from your mobile phone</figcaption></figure>
<p>Its curves are subjective and divisive; The screen looks great, with the punchy contrast and sharpness that&#8217;s been a Samsung flagship mainstay for years. We&#8217;ll get back to that edge, but it&#8217;s the headline part of a 5.6-inch Quad-HD+ display. But let&#8217;s focus on what&#8217;s different here: that edge.</p>
<h4><strong>ONE-HANDED USE</strong></h4>
<p>Make this secondary menu transparent, allowing me to maintain all that screen space. I&#8217;d love to see something similar on the iPhone X Plus continues to clear away. While I&#8217;m not a huge selfie taker, you&#8217;ll have to ask our Senior Selfie Editor, but I do take a whole lot of photos with my smartphone.</p>
<h4><strong>SOFTWARE</strong></h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to learn more about the stylus uses, I&#8217;d advise a quick read of Brad&#8217;s Galaxy Note 4 review, because the setup is identical here. Faced with the need to differentiate hundreds candidates for every online posting, employers have added many new job requirements most of which are technical. There are two display modes you can flit between: a slender, unassuming bar that can display a customized message.</p>
<figure id="attachment_365" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-365" style="width: 1920px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://adventuresol.github.io/adventureguru/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/p3.jpg"><img class=" td-modal-image wp-image-365 size-full" src="https://adventuresol.github.io/adventureguru/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/p3.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-365" class="wp-caption-text">Woman programming her demo set</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote><p>THERE&#8217;S A WHILE BEFORE YOU GET THE LITTLE PROVISIONS WE MADE TO EASE USERS IN OUR PRODUCT</p></blockquote>
<p>The screen is marginally smaller than the Note 4, despite the cranked-up pixel count. Like the Note9, text pops a little more, and pictures you take with the 26MP camera are obviously better replicated on the screen and a more substantial column that attempts to offer extra functionality, notifications or context-dependent menus for certain apps, like the camera. Well, both remain unwieldy to grip, and the Note Edge is wider. However, the edged screen nuzzles into my hand better and those software tweaks mentioned above give it the advantage.</p>
<p>Does this mean there&#8217;s a soft skills shortage or that Millennials are all late, disorganized poor communicators? The punctual, organized and well-spoken Millennials whom employers should want have played by the rules and completed college degrees.</p>

<p>The screen is marginally smaller than the Note 4, despite the cranked-up pixel count.

Well, both remain unwieldy to grip, and the Note Edge is wider. However, the edged screen nuzzles into my hand better and those software tweaks mentioned above give it the advantage.</p>
<p>Does this mean there&#8217;s a soft skills shortage or that Millennials are all late, disorganized poor communicators? The punctual, organized and well-spoken Millennials whom employers should want have played by the rules and completed college degrees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The exploration of space stands as one of humanity&#8217;s greatest achievements. While history has hailed the men and women who reached the cosmos, and those who helped them get there, much of the infrastructure that sent them skyward lies forgotten and dilapidated. This may look a little unusual, but swishing through the various mini-screens is immensely satisfying.</p>
<p>A 2017 survey found that employers have a very or somewhat difficult time finding people with the requisite soft skills. But what if employers are looking for soft skills and are not seeing them? The vast majority of mid-size and large employers in the US, UK and Canada utilize Applicant Tracking Systems.</p>
<figure id="attachment_363" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-363" style="width: 1920px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://adventuresol.github.io/adventureguru/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/p1.jpg"><img class=" td-modal-image wp-image-363 size-full" src="https://adventuresol.github.io/adventureguru/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/p1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1184" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-363" class="wp-caption-text">Space trips about to start next year</figcaption></figure>
<p>Roland Miller has spent nearly half his life chronicling these landmarks before they are lost forever long been obsessed with space as a child, he dreamed of being an astronaut. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) make it possible for employers to post new positions online and manage the hundreds of applicants who typically respond to each opportunity. No human hiring manager reviews hundreds of applications.</p>
<blockquote><p>my friends and colleagues have offered up reactions ranging from outright bemusement to adoration.</p></blockquote>
<p>The image stabilizing works well on all the neon lights that pepper Tokyo, while even people were neatly captured. There&#8217;s some noise, but it compares favorably against older Galaxy phones. Daylight meant effortless captures and some really nice shots, if I say so myself.</p>
<h4><strong>HARDWARE</strong></h4>
